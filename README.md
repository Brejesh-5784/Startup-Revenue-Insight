   ```

> 💡 You can generate the `requirements.txt` using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

4. **Ensure the model file is present**:
   Make sure `model.pkl` is in the same directory as `app.py`.

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd startup-profit-predictor
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. The app will open in your browser (usually at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).
